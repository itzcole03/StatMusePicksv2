This file has been intentionally left as a placeholder.
The project previously included a bundled `nba-proxy` that used the server-side
`nba_api` library. Per the current repository direction the packaged proxy
has been removed. If you want to run `nba_api` directly, create a small
backend service (Python/Flask, FastAPI, or similar) that imports `nba_api`
and exposes only the endpoints your frontend requires. Keep such services
out of the frontend workspace if you prefer no proxy artifacts committed.
